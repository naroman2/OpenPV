This repository exists to support our ASU EE capstone project.  We strive to build a user interface toolkit to assist non-technical people in making informed decisions regarding solar module installation.

# Desired Features:
* Create a graphical user interface ()
* Initial startup menu to link user to the api key form so that they can use their own key and it would be stored.
* Presets for home loads (fridge, ac, )
* Recommendations about daily load usage and times.
* Time of day/range with peak production
* Google earth view and way to outline multiple regions of solar
* Customized electric cost $/kWh for different states
